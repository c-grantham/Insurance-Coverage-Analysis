# Introduction
This in-progress project utilizes machine learning and data analysis techniques to predict the appropriate level of insurance coverage for individuals based on relevant features. By analyzing patterns in existing data, the model aims to recommend an optimal coverage level and then estimate the associated cost. The goal is to provide a data-backed method of insurance pricing, offering personalization and accuracy for insurance policies. I am currently exploring different machine learning models to determine the most effective approach for prediction and evaluation. As the project is still in progress, ongoing work focuses on developing the initial model that will predict an individual's coverage level. Once this is complete, the coverage cost model will be developed utilizing data predicted by the first model. Final work will include optimizing the algorithms and analyzing their performance in real-world situations. The dataset used for this project is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teertha/ushealthinsurancedataset.
